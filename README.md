# net-422
Final project for NET422 (Web Technologies) at Western Illinois University with Atilla Gallio.-

# Concept Corner Website
- Main ideia: We developed an webpage where users can share their ideas over game concepts and give their opinions. On the main page, topics of current games are displayed and the users can access them and create new ideas.The ideas can be viewed by other users and they can comment on them.

- Techonlogy used: We used the LAMP architectural model with different web technologies such as HTML5, PHP, XLM and SCHEMA. For the information storage and database operations, we used MySQL throught PHPmyAdmin to manage the database. To test the web application, we used Xaamp to run an Apache and MySQL servers.

# Features
- Login: The users can login via a facebook account plugin. It is not possible to create new ideas for a game without being logged. The user will only be able to view the idea list and select one of them for more information if he is not logged.
Add new game: Only the website administrators can add new games to the database.
Add new idea: Once logged, the user can search throught different games and post an idea to it. All the fields must be filled and there is a validation check to make sure that none information is missing.
Comment: To post comment, the Facebook plugin is used so, any comment in a game idea will be displayed for any user to see it.
